** Objective: **
My aim is to acquire hands-on, code-first experience in deep learning theories, models, and skills relevant to practical applications and scientific progress. I emphasize identifying problems suitable for deep learning, selecting optimal models, implementing them effectively, visualizing and justifying findings, and drawing inspiration from neuroscience. Additionally, I prioritize the ethical use of deep learning techniques.
